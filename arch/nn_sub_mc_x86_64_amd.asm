; About: This code is an assembly implementation of
; Bill's nn_add_mc function for x64 processors, influenced
; by his blog and code in nn.c. Finished with a lot of help
; from the mailing list.

; Assumptions: word_t is uint64_t and 8 bytes wide

; data segment. 
SECTION .data

; code segment.

; function code.

    ; Stack frame for this function

    ; push    rbp
    ; mov     rbp, rsp

    ; arguments to functions. 
    ; arguments are in:
    ; * rdi (a)
    ; * rsi (b)
    ; * rdx (c)
    ; * rcx  (m)
    ; * r8  (ci)

    ; zero rax
    xor      rax, rax

    ; load the address of the ends of the word_t arrays.
    lea rdi, [rdi + rcx*8]
    lea rsi, [rsi + rcx*8]
    lea rdx, [rdx + rcx*8]

    ; rcx is a positive value of m. Negate it.
    neg      rcx

    ; determine if there is a carry.
    sar      r8d, 1

    ; if rcx==0, exit.
