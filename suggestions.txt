Here's a list of suggestions and who made them:

* word_t might cause a namespace conflict with other libraries - D. Harvey

* why not use C++ (which has namespaces) - D. Harvey

* C does automatic arithmetic conversions when using binary operators, thus explicit casts for things like ci = (word_t) 1 - ci are not required. - M. Patel.
